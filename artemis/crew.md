# Crew profiles

## Commander — G. Reid Wiseman
**Role on Artemis II:** Commander — overall mission and crew leader aboard Orion.

**Background & career highlights**
- Former U.S. Navy pilot and engineer. Long career in aviation and flight operations.
- Selected as a NASA astronaut in 2009.
- Previous spaceflight experience: Flight engineer on Expedition 41 to the International Space Station (2014) — long-duration mission with significant science time.
- Served in leadership roles inside NASA (including time as Chief of the Astronaut Office).

**What he brings to Artemis II**
- Deep operational experience running complex missions and crewed systems.
- Hands-on experience with ISS operations, EVA planning, and international crew coordination.

**Quick facts**
- Leadership, procedural discipline, and experience with long-duration missions make him a natural commander for the first crewed Orion flight.

## Pilot — Victor J. Glover
**Role on Artemis II:** Pilot — vehicle handling, guidance support, and systems operations for Orion.

**Background & career highlights**
- Naval aviator and test pilot with extensive flight-test experience.
- Selected as a NASA astronaut in 2013 (Group 21).
- Veteran of long-duration ISS flight (SpaceX Crew-1 / Expedition 64/65) where he served as a station systems flight engineer and completed multiple EVAs.

**What he brings to Artemis II**
- Significant experience with spacecraft operations and test flights, plus proven ability to manage systems under stress.
- Flight-test mindset useful for a first crewed test of Orion/SLS.

**Quick facts**
- Known for strong systems knowledge, calm under pressure, and operational discipline developed as a test pilot and naval officer.

## Mission Specialist — Christina Hammock Koch
**Role on Artemis II:** Mission Specialist — systems operations, science, and mission-specific tasks.

**Background & career highlights**
- Electrical engineer and NASA astronaut (selected 2013).
- Extensive spaceflight experience: long-duration ISS crewmember (Expeditions 59/60/61) and participant in historic ISS EVA activities.
- Held the record for the longest single continuous spaceflight by a woman (2019 mission, ~328 days).

**What she brings to Artemis II**
- Deep experience in long-duration human factors and science operations.
- Strong background in remote instrument engineering and field science.

**Quick facts**
- Experienced in EVAs and long-term physiological research — valuable for validating Orion life-support and crew health monitoring.

## Mission Specialist — Jeremy Hansen (Canadian Space Agency)
**Role on Artemis II:** Mission Specialist — spacecraft systems, mission experiments, and representing CSA partnership.

**Background & career highlights**
- Canadian Space Agency astronaut with operational and piloting experience.
- Trained extensively on Orion mockups and mission procedures as part of the international Artemis team.
- Hansen will be Canada’s first astronaut to travel to the Moon.

**What he brings to Artemis II**
- International partnership experience and cross-agency training.
- Adds additional hands-on capability for systems checks, procedures, and delegation of mission tasks.

**Quick facts**
- His participation highlights international cooperation on Artemis and Canada’s contribution to lunar exploration.

# What the crew will test on Artemis II
- Life support systems and environmental controls under crewed load.
- Communications across distances and deep-space navigation checks.
- Crew procedures for long-duration deep-space sorties and emergency scenarios.
- Orion systems under live crew input, including power, thermal, and avionics behavior.

---

# Timeline & public-facing milestones to watch
- **Prelaunch tests:** closeout and dress rehearsals (countdown demonstration tests).
- **Launch:** Orion on SLS from Kennedy Space Center.
- **Lunar flyby:** Free-return trajectory that swings around the Moon to validate crewed operations beyond low Earth orbit.
- **Return & splashdown:** Earth re-entry and recovery operations — public data and imagery will follow.

---

# Talking points & quick summaries (useful for presentations)
- **Why Artemis II matters:** It’s the first time astronauts will take Orion and SLS on a crewed lunar flyby — the mission proves systems and human factors needed for future lunar landings and Mars planning.
- **Crew diversity and experience:** The four-person crew blends leadership, test flying, long-duration research experience, and international partnership.
- **What to watch:** launch performance, communications latency tests, crew health telemetry, and Orion re-entry data.

# Handy one-liner bios (for slides)
- **Reid Wiseman:** Navy pilot and mission leader; experienced ISS flight engineer turned Artemis II commander.
- **Victor Glover:** Test-pilot turned astronaut; pilot for Artemis II, veteran of Crew-1 long-duration ISS mission.
- **Christina Koch:** Electrical engineer and record-setting long-duration astronaut; mission specialist focused on systems and crew health.
- **Jeremy Hansen:** CSA astronaut and mission specialist; Canada’s first Moon-bound crewmember and Orion systems operator.

# Notes for presenters / students
- Keep slides short: use the one-liners, then 2–3 bullets per astronaut on a second slide with background and mission responsibilities.
- If you need imagery, use official NASA or CSA photos (public domain or media-use images) for accuracy.
