# Artemis App Revamp & Feature Expansion Prompt

## Core Objective

Transform the Artemis app from a collection of cool features into a **cohesive, guided mission experience** that aligns with Apple’s Swift Student Challenge judging philosophy: clarity, storytelling, education, and experience design over raw technical complexity.

---

## Core Mission Statement (Define First)

> “Create an immersive, guided Artemis mission experience that teaches users how space missions work — from vehicle systems to crew dynamics to mission execution — using AR, AI, and interactive learning.”

This is not an AR demo app.
This is an **educational mission simulation experience**.

---

## Product Philosophy

### Build for:

* Experience over features
* Narrative over novelty
* Flow over freedom
* Learning over entertainment
* Coherence over complexity

### Avoid:

* Disconnected feature tabs
* Random exploration UX
* Tech-first design
* Feature stacking without purpose
* “Look what I built” product thinking

---

## Structural Redesign (System Architecture)

### Replace Feature Tabs With Mission Flow

**Current Model:**

* AR
* Chat
* Learn

**New Model: Mission-Based Architecture**

1. 🧭 Mission Briefing
2. 🚀 Vehicle Systems
3. 🧑‍🚀 Crew Interaction
4. 🌕 Mission Simulation
5. 📚 Knowledge Layer

Each section unlocks progressively.

---

## User Journey Flow

### Opening Experience

* Cinematic intro
* Artemis branding
* Mission context
* "Begin Mission" CTA

---

### Guided Flow Example

1. **Mission Briefing**

   * Artemis goals
   * Mission objectives
   * Timeline visualization
   * Interactive map of Earth → Moon

2. **Vehicle Systems**

   * AR SLS rocket
   * Tap components to explore:

     * Stage 1
     * Stage 2
     * Orion capsule
     * Fuel systems
     * Heat shield
   * Contextual learning overlays

3. **Crew Interaction**

   * Astronaut AI chat
   * Crew roles
   * Mission responsibilities
   * Scenario-based conversations

4. **Mission Simulation**

   * Launch sequence
   * Orbit phase
   * Lunar trajectory
   * Docking
   * Landing
   * Visual timeline progression

5. **Knowledge Layer**

   * Learning cards
   * Interactive quizzes
   * Concept unlocks
   * System diagrams
   * Mission facts

## Feature Revamp Strategy

### AR Feature

From: "3D rocket viewer"
To: **Interactive spacecraft learning system**

Add:

* Component tap zones
* Layer toggles
* System flow animations
* Educational overlays
* Failure mode simulations

---

### AI Chat Feature

From: "Chat with astronauts"
To: **Role-based mission intelligence system**

Add:

* Role-specific AI agents:

  * Commander
  * Engineer
  * Scientist
  * Flight Director

* Scenario prompts:

  * Launch failure
  * System malfunction
  * Navigation decisions
  * Emergency protocols

---

### Learning System

From: "Tinder-style cards"
To: **Progressive knowledge unlocking system**

Add:

* Unlock-based content
* Concept trees
* Learning paths
* Achievement-based progression
* Mission milestones

---

## UX Principles

* Guided progression > free exploration
* Story-driven navigation
* Minimal UI friction
* Cognitive simplicity
* Visual hierarchy
* Immersive transitions
* Flow-state design

---

## Educational Framing

The app should be framed as:

> “An interactive learning platform for understanding real space missions.”

Not:

> “A cool AR space app.”

---

## Submission Positioning Statement

> “An immersive mission-based learning experience that allows students to explore the Artemis program through guided storytelling, AR system visualization, AI-powered crew interaction, and progressive knowledge discovery.”

---

## Feature Expansion Ideas

### High-Impact Additions

* Mission timeline simulator
* Launch sequence animation
* Orbital mechanics visualizer
* Fuel consumption models
* Trajectory planning system
* Decision-based mission branching
* Interactive mission failures

---

## Design Language

* Cinematic
* Minimal
* Premium
* Scientific
* Purposeful
* Educational
* Narrative-driven

---

## Strategic Rule

If a feature does not:

* Serve the mission narrative
* Teach something real
* Improve user understanding
* Strengthen the experience flow

→ It does not get built.

---

## Dev Mindset

Build like:

* Product designer
* Experience architect
* Educator
* Storyteller

Not just:

* Swift developer
* AR engineer
* LLM integrator

---

## One-Line Internal Rule

> "We are not building features — we are building a mission experience."
