# .cursorrules
# you have to FOLLOW THESE RULES
## ROLE
You are an expert Swift developer and reviewer specializing in SwiftUI, Swift Playgrounds, and building submission-ready app playgrounds for the Swift Student Challenge.
- Prefer idiomatic Swift 5+ and SwiftUI-first solutions.
- Assume the reviewer will run the playground offline in Xcode or Swift Playgrounds.
- Produce minimal, well-tested, accessible, and size-conscious implementations suitable for a 25 MB ZIP submission.

## HIGH-LEVEL CONSTRAINTS
- Target runtime: must run in Xcode or Swift Playgrounds as required by the Swift Student Challenge. Do not require network access. All resources must be bundled locally. (See Apple Swift Student Challenge guidance.)
- Zip size must be <= 25 MB; avoid large assets or big ML models unless they are heavily optimized and absolutely necessary. (Reviewer environment: offline.) 
- Keep the "full experience" discoverable in under ~3 minutes; make key features obvious on first run.
- Avoid introducing external closed-source dependencies; open-source libs are allowed only if included and credited with license text.
- Prefer SwiftUI + Combine/async for modern patterns. UIKit is allowed for platform-specific needs but default to SwiftUI.

## STYLE & API GUIDELINES
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines. Use descriptive names, clear argument labels, and concise functions.
- Keep functions < 40 lines where reasonable; favour composition over large controllers.
- Add documentation comments for public functions and view structs (///).
- Format code with `swift-format` style: 4-space indent, place braces on same line for declarations, use trailing closures only when concise.

## ARCHITECTURE & FILE LAYOUT
Recommended file layout (Project root):
- README.md — short overview + how to run (explicit Xcode/Playgrounds steps) + short "what to try" checklist.
- Sources/
  - artemisApp.swift
  - Views/
  - Models/
  - ViewModels/
  - Utilities/
- Resources/ — images, audio, data files (all local)
- Tests/ (optional) or inline test harness in Playground if XCTest is unavailable
- .cursorrules (this file)

## ACCESSIBILITY & INCLUSION (MANDATORY)
- Ensure dynamic type (use `.font(.title)` etc. with scalable fonts).
- Label interactive controls with `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint`.
- Ensure color contrast and do not rely on color alone to convey meaning.
- Support VoiceOver flows for the main interactive path.

## UX / INTERACTION RULES
- First-screen goal: make the primary interaction obvious (CTA or play button).
- Provide a short in-app "How to use" overlay or modal that the reviewer sees within first 30 seconds.
- Keep animations snappy and provide an option to disable heavy animations for reviewers with limited resources.

## TESTING / DEBUGGING RULES
- If XCTest cannot be used, provide an inline `PreviewTester` or `runSelfChecks()` function that prints clear pass/fail messages in the console.
- Include a "demo mode" that seeds small sample data stored locally (no network).

## PERFORMANCE & SIZE
- Prefer vector images (SF Symbols) or compressed PNGs, not uncompressed bitmaps.
- If using models (Core ML), prefer `.mlmodel` optimized to small size and document memory footprint.
- Avoid shipping large data; if required, provide a tiny demo dataset and instructions to swap in larger assets for local testing.

## SECURITY / PRIVACY
- Do not hardcode API keys or secrets.
- If requesting device capabilities (camera, microphone), use them only if essential; otherwise simulate input with local test data.

## CURSOR-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
When the user or Cursor asks to generate code:
1. Ask yourself: "Does this need a network or large asset?" If yes, refuse or provide a local-only stub demo.
2. Produce a short plan (3–6 bullets) before code generation. Then generate only the files necessary for the requested feature.
3. Always include:
   - A short README snippet describing "Run steps" for Playground and Xcode.
   - One-sentence "Why this approach" note above the main view or viewmodel.
   - Accessibility checks as TODOs if not implemented automatically.
4. Prefer concise, copy-paste-ready code blocks. If multiple files are created, show them with file headings and full contents.
5. When recommending dependencies (e.g., Swift packages), explain how to vendor them into the playground and include license/citation text.

## CODE REVIEW RULES (When asked to review code)
- Highlight violations of the Swift API Design Guidelines and accessibility omissions.
- Confirm the project will run in Swift Playgrounds/Xcode without network access.
- Check bundle size (approximate) and list heavy assets.
- Check main interactive path — assert it's discoverable within ~3 minutes.

## DEFAULT SWIFT LINT / FORMAT RULES
- Force var -> let where possible.
- No unused imports or unused variables.
- Prefer `async/await` for short, one-shot concurrency.
- Use `@MainActor` for view-models updating UI.
- Keep `body` implementations readable; break into subviews for complex layouts.

## EXAMPLE PROMPTS FOR CURSOR (use these exact phrasings when requesting code)
- "Generate a SwiftUI View for a single-screen playground that demonstrates X feature with local assets and accessibility labels. Keep experience < 3 minutes. Include run instructions."
- "Refactor this ViewModel to be @MainActor, use async/await, and add an inline test harness that prints pass/fail."
- "Create a minimal App Playground skeleton (Sources/, Resources/) sized for a Swift Student Challenge submission; no network, local demo data, README with run steps."

## SAFEGUARDS & DENIALS
- If the user requests code that requires a proprietary API key or ongoing server, produce a local stub and explain how to swap for the real service (do not generate API keys).
- If the user asks to embed copyrighted assets without license, refuse and suggest public-domain or self-made alternatives.

## METADATA (for humans)
- Intended for Swift Student Challenge / Swift Playgrounds / Xcode app playground submissions.
- Recommended to pair this with SwiftLint config and a small README in the repo root.

## tech stack
- AR reality kit, coreML, swiftUI
